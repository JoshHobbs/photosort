The idea is to quickly sort through a massive photo collection using vanilla php to filter metadata and use the effiency of typing to refine what cannot be filtered automatically. 
PHP Syntax and image metadata functions are used to define statistics on each image.
Those Statistics can be used to help the user guide the images into a folder either automatically or by providing suggestions when unsure.
Each image in /images/ folder is to be sorted into one of the folders inside of /sorted/
Each folder in /sorted/ is listed on the page as a keyboard key to be pressed, When pressed the selected "highlighted" image is to moved into that folder, this also works as a button and be can clicked or touched.
The "z" key will be used as an "undo" function allowing the user to backup a step and correct mistakes
Images following the highlight image will be loaded as thumbnails and only so many will be displayed to the user in order to prevent the browser from crashing
Metadata about the image is displayed to the right of the highlighted image to tell the user different information such as date taken, location taken, camera used, if its a screenshot or not, dimentions, file size, file name, and color statistics 
GPS Metadata will be resolved with an API or library to provide location names rather than GPS cordonates


Future versions will allow many stages of "undo"
Fix metadata in broken images
Highlight and eliminate duplicates
Allow multiable images to be selected at once for batch moving
Allow sort folder sorting, display images as list or grid
Support for video files will play in tiny player
Gather statistics on metadata and destination folders and provide suggestions based on trends and similarities
Button to create new folders to be sorted into
Have each image output color statistics as a seed, and then compare to future images so if its a resized version of it PHP will be able to tell and say how many times its been encountered before.

Scrape cloud images and use color ID function on them to see if they're already hosted online or not
